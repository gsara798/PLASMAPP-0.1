# PLASMAPP: One-dimensional electrostatic particle-in-cell simulations 
Authors: Sara Gómez from Universidad EAFIT, and Jaime Humberto Hoyos from Universidad de Medellín.

App developed in MATLAB App Designer for electrostatic 1D particle-in-cell simulations. The PIC algorithm is based on the work of Giovanni Lapenta from K.U.Leuven.

If you want to install PlasmAPP, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the folder "Install PlasmAPP".
2. Open MATLAB and go to the "APPS" tab and then click on "Install APP".

If yo want to see the code, you can follow these steps:
1. Download the folder "PlasmAPP code".
2. In MATLAB click on the tab "Open" and selec the Folder PlasmAPP code and open the files: "Start.mlapp", "Inputs.mlapp", and "Main.mlapp".

3. Select the tab "Start.mlapp" and then you can run the APP.

The code "Start.mlapp" shows the logo of PlasmAPP, you have to click on the logo to open the graphical interface of "Inputs.mlapp". Here you will choose the parameters of the system, the parameters of the beam, the numerical methods for solving equations of motion and Poisson's equantion, and the diagnostics that you want to see. When you click on "run" the PIC code will be runing in the program "Main.mlapp", then you will see the graphical interface of this code where you con see the diagnostics of the system, the energy conservation error, the momentum conservation error, and the execution time. For more information, please download the file "User_manual_PlasmAPP.pdf". Aditionally, if you want to see how the method work, you can open the file "PIC_LIVE_EDITOR". There is a version in PDF and another in MATLAB.
